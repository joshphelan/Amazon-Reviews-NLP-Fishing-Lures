I keep stocked up
","
This is my go to worm on the Little Pigeon River in Tennessee. I saw this on You Tubes Creek Fishing Adventures. When all else fails I turn to this. Many days this was all I needed to haul in large Smallmouth. My current PB was caught on this worm.

It just works
","
One of my most successful soft plastics, the Yum 5-inch stick baits get bit when nothing else in my bag-of-tricks seem to be working. I find that they work best for me as a finesse bait, letting the bait do the work as it falls with just the hook providing the weight.  The chartreuse tip is a money-maker. But the quality control and durability is not perfect.  The tip comes partially detached sometimes, especially when using it with a wacky rig.  I can generally reuse the bait after a catch, but I have occasionally had fish bite the bait in half.  It has a slot built in to help make your Texas rig more weedless.  But I find that the Texas rig doesn’t survive as well for repeated use as the line tears the end fairly easily when but. Keep in mind though, that the durability issues are mostly because it is getting bit! As a result, I find them well worth the price.

Yum Dingers Are Good But Different
","
I have had good results with Yum Dingers. They don't seem to have as high of salt content and are more buoyant than others. They seem to float more or sink slower but have plenty of swimming action either wacky or Texas rigged. I add a small weights if a faster sink is needed. A Texas rigged Dinger has a great natural looking swimming action that seems irresistible to bass. Dingers are a great value.

Decent action, but overall disappointed.

Good color and great action! My complaints are with price/durability, if you look at my attached picture you can see each one split like this at the tail within 1-2 casts. I mostly use z-man plastics so I was pretty shocked at how little durability the plastic itself has. I had 1 nice bass hit it and it was done for. I can usually get 6-8 off a z-man before it needs to be trashed. So granted it looks like the price came down to better fit the quality. I paid almost $8 for a pack of 6, felt robbed after seeing the quality.

I bought these in the orange (bubblegum lemon swirl) color because they look like what John from Creek Fishing Adventures uses in a lot of bass fishing videos. They look like skinny Cheetos puffs. I have no idea why a bass would think these were food of any kind, but they do. I've only taken them fishing once, but I caught half a dozen good-sized spotted bass with them already using a Texas rig. These work well.

I love these senko style worms and have caught many bass on them. If they could salt them a little more I would use them more for weightless wacky rigs.

From Now On I Will Pay More Attention To My Son
","
This is one of the most effective lures I have ever used.  My son gave me a pack and I politely put in my box and thanked him; all the while thinking""how could this lure catch any thing? It looks like a cheap cigar""  One very, very slow day after I tried almost everything in my box but the can opener I came across the Dinger.  By this time it was noon, hot and bright.  I caught six or eight fish in the next dozen casts.  Fish it slow or dead stick it.  They will pick it up off the bottom.  When it gets beat up fish it wacky rig.  This lure has been my first choice since that day.I started bass fishing on the St. Johns River in Florida sixty-four years ago.  I wish this lure had been around back then.

Yum dingers are pretty reputable, so I’ll attach a picture and say they’re soft plastics.Update: After having fished them for a hot minute, I’ve concluded that these things generally do not hold up for more than one fish.

Great Worms, but....They rip apart quicker, but bring in more bass than the Senko's
","
Amazing worm lures, hits on almost every cast. Here's the downside: after a big bass hits the plastic worm, and you bring that bass in, chances are the worm lure will be trashed after one catch. They move more freely than the Senko worms and actually mimic a live worm moving much better than the Senko underwater. I am using it with a EWG 4/0 Razor Sharp Eagle Claw hook and the Yum Dinger size 5 worms.... I have also tried them with 1/0, 2/0, 3/0 and live worm hooks, they still break easily...They work fine without a 1/4 ounce Texas Rig weight- if you are casting into shallow water, otherwise I use a 1/4 ounce Texas rig in 12-20 feet of water. I have tried them also as a wacky worm setup with O rings (I use 2 O rings in a crisscross pattern), not as effective. I would give this worm 5 stars if the plastic lure lasted longer, so here is what I do, order them at W-----t for 2.97 and bite the bullet on how long they last. The 7"" Senko's also do not have a channel to make the lure weed free, and the Yum Dinger's 5"" worms do have that channel... I have a higher catch rate on these vs. the Senko's, the Zoom Brush Hog, the Zoom Baby Brush Hog, and the Yum Ribbontail. I also use the Berkley Trilene Green Monofilament 12 lb. line.  I also love the red Eagle Claw EWG hooks that I buy at W-----t, like the Gamakatsu, red hooks are supposed to be the best color to use, since bass have a problem seeing the color red, according to the pros. Bottom line- If you get these plastic worms, you won't be disappointed.

This is twice what you pay in the store but with the current state of the world, it's better than going in the store. You can get a 30 pack for thus cost. That said, Yum dingers catch fish. Throw it 15 yards int9 the shallow. Wait for it to hit bottom. Pull up quick twice and wait for it sink. Reel in the slack as it does so. Repeat every 5 to 10 seconds. Bass have to strike

Great color to use for bass up here in central Mass. Ended up going thru the whole bag of 100 in a month and a half. Durable worms that don't have to be replaced every time you get a hit or even catch a bass on it. 5 stars all day long

Great product, false description.  Very annoyed with Amazon for not pulling this ad, after reading the reviews it appears that it’s been going on for quite some time. Green pumpkin is not watermelon flake.. This may sound like an unimportant detail, but where I fish, for whatever reason it makes a huge difference, and I was specifically looking for green pumpkin. There was no need for me to read the reviews, because I’m very familiar with the brand and the color. We should be able to trust Amazon to step in when The seller is clearly and continuingly lying about their product.  We shouldn’t have to read the reviews to find out that there’s an ongoing problem with the seller lying.

The only bad thing was they were slimy and a little stiff. But I just soaked them in hot water for about a half hour and rinsed them a couple times then wiped them off with a paper towel.

Man, rig a Zoom Brush Hog 'tex-posed style' on a #5/0 extra-wide gap worm hook with a 1/2oz bullet weight & some good strong braid(I use Power Pro braid exclusively on ALL of my reels), drop it into the weed pockets, lily pads or brush piles and HOLD ON!  It gets in and out of heavy cover & that's where the big mammas can bury up, especially when the sun gets high in the sky.  Hard shadows & bright sun positions fish tight to cover, actually making em easier to pin-point(sometimes - the are NO 'rules' when it comes to fishing!).In clearer water I like the more natural-looking colors like green pumpkin, bullfrog, etc.  With murkier water, I like the blacks & blues, junebug, etc.If you really wanna target BIG fish, try hanging a Zoom Brush Hog off the back of a heavy flipping jig.  Make sure you use appropriate gear though - this is no place for buggy whip rods & light line... you want baitcasting gear on a heavy rod & stout 50# or 65# braid.

I'm new to using the wacky rig, but after watching some videos, I realized that this kit has everything you need to get started. Tons of worms in a variety of colors - I tested them out today and they're solid - seemed to hold up really well during a day of fishing, and had good action as they were sinking in the water column. The number of hooks provided was really nice, as well as the variety of nail weights to change up the sinking action. The O-Ring Tool that's included, with all the O-rings, makes this kit really worth the buy - works perfectly well and you don't need to buy a separate tool from another spot to complete your setup.

This is one of the best buys I've found on Amazon for plastic worm fishing bait. There is a ton of good quality worms in several different colors for a very small price and it all comes in one little box that you just throw in with your gear and go! This also comes with hooks, weights, bands and the tool to make using the bands very easy! Already caught several bass with these using both top water and drop shot methods! To top it all off these are durable and thick! Will last a ton of casts and catches before needing replaced!

What an amazing wacky rig kit. When trying to buy everything you need to rig a wacky rig, from wacky tool, O rings, hooks, nail weight(Neko rigging) and then the senko worms, it adds up fast. This kit comes with everything you need. It’s amazing the abundance of worms you get for the money and all great colors that are great for luring bass in my experience. The kit also comes with a wacky tool and rings and plenty of wacky hooks and some 3/0 hooks for Texas rigs. The worms also feel very durable. Overall I am very pleased with this kit.

I was highly impressed with the color variations of the worms that come with the product. There are several for different kinds of water conditions which can make you very versatile next time you're on the water. The product also came with different hooks if you want to tie a texas rig or a wacky rig, so you have options. The o-ring tool was also a huge plus! Using the rings helps increase the strength and durability of your artificial worms so they last longer as they survive through any wear and tear! Best of luck on your next fishing venture!

EVERYTHING you need to catch some bass! I was surprised this kit came with different size nail weights and some pretty sharp hooks as well. The included wacky rig o-ring tool and extra o-rings are great for helping to prevent losing/tearing baits and the leash with clip is a nice addition.I nose rigged these salted stick baits to test the durability and I never had one fly off on a cast so I was super impressed with the quality. All organized in a plastic box for easy storing. Tight lines!

 I have fished with most of the big brand name plastic worms and have caught Bass with all of them. What I like about this Plusinno Worm Kit is that it offers the beginner or experienced fisherman with everything needed to catch Large Mouth Bass, except a rod and reel of course.  It comes with two types of hooks to fish either Wacky Rig style, with the provided plastic rings and ring tool, or to fish using a weedless Texas Rig method.  The peg weights come in three sizes and the entire kit is boxed up nice and neat and fits easily in my fishing bag.  Plastic worms have always been the #1 artificial lure for catching Large Mouth Bass and if you have never tried fishing a worm Wacky style then here is your chance to try it out.

I caught a nice sized bass with the red worm.  I like the assortment, wacky tool, hooks, and everything.  This product would get five stars, but the box warped after a couple days on my kayak.  A couple more days and it warped so bad that it wouldn't stay latched anymore, at one time dumping the contents out.  Not a huge deal, I just moved it to a clear plastic tackle box.  I recommend you also move the contents to another, sturdier box.

I bought 5 different packs of these swim baits (assorted colors), all in the 4"".At the lake I fish at near my house, swim baits are a common staple for bass, crappie, and trout.I've even caught a few carp and a huge catfish.These lures have some nice things, but they also a few disappointments.PROS:1. The soft plastic used to make the lures, makes them feel almost life like.2. The 3D eyes are mounted better than some lures.3. The colors are very well done.CONS:1. The lures are not very durable.They do tend to tear rather easily.2. The aluminum strip, although good in theory, fails miserably in application.Catch the aluminum strip with the point or barb of the hook, and it pulls right out of the lure.3. This is a lure thats just shy of 4"", yet the paddletail size is something you would see on a 1-2* lure.Because the paddletail is so small there is barely any action.

Caught my first fish on the #2 model. They swim well, and are super realistic. All the fish I could see including other minnows were interested in it.The only complaint is that the foil inside the lure will crumple and get distorted when you place a hook in it. Even if you hook to the side of the foil a bite will cause the same issue. If the foil gets distorted too much it changes the shape and therefore the functionality of the lure. So they made need replacing after a few uses, not the most durable and they are a bit pricey but they will catch fish

DO NOT THREAD THE HOOK THROUGH THE MIDDLE

the durability isn’t the best. the only reason i’m reviewing is because everybody had problems with the hook up and the foil ripping out. there is a small pocket on the top of the lure to thread the hook through. you do not go through the middle of the lure the hook barely threads through a gap in the top of the minnow.

Good action in water visibly. Fish frequently bite at this. I catch alot if small mouth bass, largemouth bass, chain pickerel. Bought 2 packs used 6 with one 2# bass caught. The other 5 I could feel the attacks then they stop. Theses 5 when reeled in were missing the tails they were but off. I gave three stars as it could be my technique but I feel it's the tail is too thin and soft to give it action but they don't allow for teasing the fish to bite again as these baits can't handle multiple hits. I purchased some more durable 4 inch swimbaits with tails. We will see. These however I feel are too thin and soft in the tail.

Leurres de bonne qualité.Taille de 10 cm et poids d'environ 6 g par leurre.En matériaux très souple, attention l'intérieur est creux, il y a un petit trou à l'arrière qui à servi pendant la fabrication pour insérer une feuille d'aluminium pour créer le reflet métallique. Cette feuille étant arrondie, l'intérieur est rempli d'air.A prendre en compte lors du montage de la ligne.Sinon ces leurres sont très bien.

Che dire la foto parla chiaro, montate su un amo piombato da 7 gr. movimento fluido e naturale. Direi ottime per il prezzo che costano.

Allora, devo dire che dopo 30 anni che pratico spinning, tra mare e fiume di artificiali ne ho visti e usati un bel po', da quelli più conosciuti, diventati una dotazione di diverse generazioni, a quelli che, usati una volta, li butti nel cesso. Tornando a questo artificiale dopo averlo usato in mare dalla spiaggia, vedendo la cura con cui è fatto, come si muove in acqua, la resa che ha avuto al primo utilizzo, con spigola di 2 kg, mi sento di poter dire che è una spanna sopra a tanti artificiali di marche più blasonate immeritatamente.È impressionante come si muove in acqua e quelle lamine riflettenti gli danno quei guizzi di luce che, di certo, si fanno notare anche a distanza.Promosso a pieni voti.

The plastic on these is perfectly soft. It'll last for all of 1 catch and then the plastic will rip at the nose, the hook wont seat very well, and will have a large gash where the hook was coming up through the lure. If you're lucky, the fins wont tear on the first catch either.Bought them cause cheaper than the Googans. I more than get my $'s worth with the Googans, lasting several fish before I might need to rotate the lure to re-hide/seat the hook properly

My good friend and fishing partner turned me on to these. I used to use primarily mepps buck tails size five and reef runners. I had much success on both until I kept getting out-fished by my friend. We both grew up fishing the lakes of Wisconsin and know where the fish are. Since using these I have consistently caught more fish. Our favorite is the blue fleck.I thought I'd never catch a Muskie with one. Turns out I was wrong. I hooked into two now. The attached pic was a 40"" caught on a blue fleck this spring.It takes a little practice becoming successful fishing these so watch videos and have patience.

I bought this item to cast out into the local ponds to practice making crawdads swim, and I don't know what's happening, but every time I use it, it keeps getting stuck on fish. It doesn't even matter how I'm using the Chigger Craw. Weightless, Texas rigged, or even with a swimbait setup - it's still the same thing over and over again. I cast it out, practice making the thing swim, and it gets caught on a bass. This is getting a little ridiculous.Seriously, what gives? Can't a guy practice making a fake crawdad swim in peace without fish getting stuck on it over and over again? And it's not like they're little fish, either. Big fish. Even a 5.4 pound largemouth bass was stuck on it the other day. You people at Berkley ought to be ashamed of yourselves!

NEVER FAILS
","
It's powerbait. Of course it works! I never used to fish for bass with plastics until I was taught how to use a Texas rig and picked up some of the 7"" power worms. All I used was hard baits and even then I only had faith in a few of them. These worked so many times for me in every situation, I ALWAYS have one Texas rigged on my bait caster. I caught my first bass on a plastic with one of these, and my biggest bass yet on it, a 6.3lber. Two things berkley makes that I never fish fresh OR saltwater without: GULP, and POWERBAIT

I prefer these ribbon worms to a stick bait 9 out of 10 times.  They have great movement when you are reeling them back, but also work well as a slow finesse lure.If I don't know whether I'd like to have an active or passive presentation for the fish, I like to tie these on.  That way I have the option to do both without retying

Crazy color patterns and super small. 2.5 inch is my estimate. Crappie sized swimbaits. They come in a nice box and each color is wrapped in a baggie that is open on one end. This means lots of bent tails and they slip out of the bags and go everywhere. They do get bites and work fine if you're cheap and don't want to pay for the real thing. The box is nicer than the baits.

For the price, durable with good action
","
Update 7/8/22Prices have come back down to reasonable competitive rates. At $14-$15 (4"" 20ct), they are back to a pretty good value.I've been fishing with these for over a year now and have caught too many largemouth bass to count with the same two 20ct packages. I occasionally switch to Keitech and Strike King every now and then, but the Runcl swimbaits last a good bit longer than the others. Well worth a try at the current prices!--------------------------------I would suggest to shop around before you buy these. The prices have increased about 40-50% from what they were sold for last year. At $12, the 4"" sized swimbaits were a great value. currently, they are price gouging because of the trending demand the past low price reviews have brought in.Since they are now priced about the same (per each bait) as all other major brands such as Keitech, Strike King, and Googan Squad, which all have better action and quality, I would pass on these until the prices go back down. These are generic swimbaits that should be priced as such for the average quality that you get. It doesn't make any sense paying for generic at brand name prices. Me and my friends used to buy these at $11.99... now some colors cost over $19! I'd pass.

Wasnt sure about the quality or the color of these baits at first... Sure am glad I took the risk. Fished these a ton of different ways this past summer, all with success. Surprisingly durable. I lost a few tails to fish chomps, and cracked a few more on some big old bass, but at that point it's worth it. Still have plenty left, and will have some leftover for early next year. Fantastic as a trailer.

The product is just as it notes in the description. For the price you pay it is about average. The one sticking point is that the tails don’t last as long as I would expect them to. The do tear off after an good handful of casts. For this I give it an average wrecker overall. The good thing is that it has caught me some fish as the colors work great for bait fish or shad!

These are a great price. And good movement. And everything works great. However, these smell like they were made with the worste chemicals ever.

Since getting these for trailers no bites. I like the price if you have some scent would be good for these.

I personally ordered the white pearl color, and the swimming motion and presentation is flawless on a standard jighead. The very first one I used lasted me the entire day even after multiple bowfin and crappie (i probably could have changed it out, but i really wanted to test it's durability). I'm not sure if it is just the white pearl color or others, but these worms will want to try to dye different colors if they are places next to other colored plastics, so keep them separate from other worms! That is really the only downside to them that i see at this time after multiple uses. I will for sure order more in the future

I've been fishing in the local ponds around central Ohio this spring with limited success.  I've tried everything from Yum Dingers, Wacky Worms, Crankbaits, spinner baits, finesse worms, etc., and nothing has worked all that great.  I tried this brown magic swim baits and man do they work.  The best set up for me is to either Texas rig them or rig them with a weedless hook with no weight at all, just slowing working it with a twitch and letting the bait fall.  In just an hour's worth of fishing I usually get 10-15 strikes and catch about half of those.  Awesome lure, thank you!

I have some Storm lures similar to these, but the Storm's are weighted inside.  You have to add some weight for these to show the correct tail action.  These--at a little over 3.5""--are a little on the small side.  Keeper bass go for something longer and larger.  I have good luck with the Storm wagging tails.  No luck with these yet.

I actually bought these back in May and finally got around to using them. The bass were going nuts on them!Pros:- excellent fish response- relatively sturdy - many fish and not a lot of damage- not too heavy or light- the swimming action is spectacularCons:- only 2 colors have worked so far- the big hook on top seemed to catch on everything from twigs to every little plant while I lost about 50% of the bass who flopped off as I was pulling in. I know it’s partly that I need to keep them low when pulling in- I keep losing the best colors to snags and you can only buy the packs and not individual colors.

Well, The baits arrived yesterday afternoon, They are the japan style hooks with the magnet. I was slow at work so i tied one on and pitched it out back in our canal. Took about 2 casts to catch a bass. I was getting so many strikes. There seemed to be an issue holding the bass on the hook but eventually the magnet fell out of the bait and the hook hung naturally. The hook sets went way up. I only tied on the white one and it caught 5 bass. This morning I got up before anyone was looking.. (wife) and pitched it out there again. 2nd cast. boom, another bass. I love these baits. They are durable also. I not sure if the magnet is a good or bad thing. On the next bait I'm gonna super glue it in before I tie it on and see if the hooksets go down again.UPDATE: I ordered two more packs of these baits. We absolutely killed'em today.. 10.16.22

I’ll preface this by saying I’m not the most experienced angler out there. That being said these lures were okay. Some of them didn’t swim straight and most of them snagged on something. I was even fishing in areas with not a lot of debris in the water like man made ponds and reservoirs and these still seemed to get snagged more than anything else which was surprising since they don’t have any treble hooks on them.Overall, they’re okay. I would buy again if they came with a weed guard.

We [son] just fished the Little Tennessee for 4 days. Three kayaking from the dam on down, then one day wading at Needmore. By the middle of the first day all we were using are these paddle tails and the Rebel Wee Craw. ALL the colors worked- black was best. Yellow 2nd. The next three days it was 100% paddle tail- down to our last two.  Lots of rocks/trees/snags [habitat] in the Little T. We pulled anchor and retrieved those last two at least 5 times. We continually [wild river fishing criteria] caught fish. I caught a 22"" Brown in the last 1/2hour of the last day. Largemouth-tons of very feisty hefty smallies - Yellow Perch- Rock Bass - aggressive big Sunnies and a juvie white bass that swam on down from the Tuck, all those fish on the paddle tails- . I stocked up and will try them on Lake Hartwell[ local for me]. Cast far- dont get stuck real easy- Cant recommend them enough.

These lures looks just like a minnow or a small fish. Its body size matches closely to the ones in my lake too. I fish these with my ultra light jigging setup and it works great. The tail creates a lot of movements when jigging. The craftsmanship on these are superb. I really like the 3D eyes and the texture on the body. The soft silicone seems to allow the lure to move more naturally as well and not stiffed like hard lures. Overall I’m really happy with these. I like the gray and green ones the most.

So on the positive, these are some decent swimbaits.  The body is super soft and flexible.  The color schemes pop. The price point for the package is super competitive.My only negative was that the baits did not come with the treble hook as advertised.  Not a biggie; a split ring and treble and the problem is solved. But I decided I'll just use them for walleye instead of pike as I had originally intended.  Frankly given the size of the bait, the treble would be unnecessary.  So it all worked out. But products should come as advertised.

At first glance these are pretty big, there's only a couple lakes in Utah that I could possibly use these. There's Pine View that has Tiger Muskie and Flaming Gorge with lake trout. The way Strawberry Reservoir has been depleted over the years I highly doubt I could use these there.

Had an opportunity to use these in a salt water Bay Area this past weekend and am very pleased. They are a great quality, nice and soft,  making it easy to thread on the hook. They are realistic looking and durable - still intact after catching fish which is fantastic! They are slow on their descent , making them look more like they are swimming to the larger fish we were trying to catch.  Now all my sons want a set of their own!

First Impressions Not Very Good
","
These are beautiful looking lures, nice craftsmanship, but my first impressions using them the first time were disappointing.  Not a nibble or bite.  After my third cast, one eye popped off.  Perhaps not the best or ideal conditions when I used them in the lake I frequent.  It would help if the packaging provided guidelines on how to rig the paddle tail bait.I will try another one of these jig head soft lures some other time, but now I am skeptical about all the hype about them.

To Be Determined
","
These guys really look (and feel) the part - color tones and fade from darker on back to lighter on belly seems realistic.  The tail action is lively as well.  However, not convinced the fish are so persuaded - only mild interest so far, but it’s early in the season and local crappie and smallmouth are just now starting to become active.  Still have high hopes for these guys, but would prefer slightly smaller size option.  Overall, recommended.

These are great lures with one problem.  The double hook set up needs a narrow space between the two shanks. As is, fish twisting can sometimes remove the hooks from the lure...had it happen twice, used pliers and tried to narrow the space between the two shanks.  Hopefully that will work but a more permanent hook attachment would greatly improve this product.

Beginner bass fisherman. Used twice. First time I used this lure got a big strike but due to inexperience was unable to hook and land the fish.

I love the 4.7"" Swimbaits. Natural colors, nice swimming action, nice head movement, and nice body roll. Awesome hook assembly with the magnet to keep the hook snug against the bait, keeping it up off the bottom. Only drawback is when you speed up, they turn sideways. But when that happens, you can pull it up to the surface and it makes a cool buzz bait. So its all good.

Flip the hook to make it weedless!

I really like the softness and action of these baits, but the hooks pointed down made it difficult to work them really slow on the bottom without getting hung up. Solution? Take the hook off, flip it upside down, and magic, its attached to the magnet, putting the barbs right up against the sides of the body making it basically weedless! Will probably paint the hooks to match color to hide them even more.

Best for fish that will swallow the bait whole; may not be great for salt water

This review is for salt water fishing only.  The lure appears well-constructed, with attractive color patters and sharp hooks.  The tail oscillates nicely in the water on the retrieve.  Beware, however, that the rubber is very soft (in fairness, they do call it Power *Soft* Fishing Lures).  I fish in salt water, inshore.  Hoping the fluke or sea bass might take a run at them, I fished in the shallows and the tails all were nibbled off, one by one.  Not sure what species took to them and did the nibbling.  In any event, be aware. Perhaps these are best for lake bass?

I love the colors and I’ve caught some bass on them-2 things though-I wish the hooks were turned up instead of down and I love the magnet idea but after one or two fish, they’re gone. Durability is def an issue and the hooks facing down instead of up makes them hard to fish through weeds and lily pads. I will say that I’ve caught quite a few bass on them in the last month and I love the price, it’s just a design flaw.

these lures are irresistible to predator fish.  the colors are perfect and they are super easy to tie on or secure with a swivel.  The pre-rigged hooks are a life saver.  It really helps when a fish grabs the back end of the lure and you don't miss the set because they didn't eat it all.  they can grab just a portion of this lure and they're hooked.

Obnoxious to connect to your line

I myself usually use swivels but I also know sometimes that's not an option. Definitely not an option on these, or basically any size line 14 lb test or over. The weedless hook guard goes through the same hook hole as your line. Even when you get it through, you've already corrupted the line where you've struggled to tie on so when you hook into a medium sized bass it breaks at the tie. The worm itself does have very decent action but Definitely would NOT recommend until they redesign the tie on point.

I was excited to get these as I thought that they would catch more fish. I mean a hook on both ends... how could you miss? And if you fish it like a wacky worm, you have 3 hooks. Sure thing!First thing was that the built in hooks were buried so deep that you couldn't put a line through them without cutting the worm. Secondly, the worms don't move like a wacky work or regular worm. Lastly, about half of them looked like a 2 year old made them out of play-duh. I don't know what they used to make it but I have never had even a nibble when using them. Must be some kind of anti-fish attractant.

My new favorite lure??
","
I originally picked these up at Dick's and found them for dirt-cheap, so I ordered some more. I had bought these alongside some similarly styled lures from other brands like Jawbone and Crappie Magnet. I have had by far the most success on these and I have been able to catch Bluegill, Bass, and Crappie with them easily. I've been swimming them on a 1/16 oz jig head and lately, they've been my go-to lures if I want to catch something.

Trying new baits is always fun, but it's really nice when you get a solid catch in an over-fished area like my local reservoir. This black crappie was caught on the Bluegrass color Baby Shad bait, while suspended by a cheap Eagle Claw Balsa-like bobber, with a Crappie Nibble riding shotgun. Catching such fish from the bank in a heavily fished area is far more challenging that from a personal fish pond, so I consider the Bobbie Garland Baby Shad a winner. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 star is that some of the baits seem to split at the mold seam that runs along the side, and jig bait notches tend to tear the fronts open. Still, a ~12"" crappie when everyone else is getting nothing but weeds and the dreaded tree limb fish? I'll take it.

I bought two dozen live minnows to go fishing with and spent the whole morning not even getting a nibble. I decided to try these little Bobby Garlands. I rigged them weightless with the a size 10 Eagle Claw hook so that the bait was threaded on the shank like a jig. It had a nice darting action. I tell you what, I couldn’t stop catching fish after that. I boated 40 fish that afternoon! Most were crappie, but I had a few nice bass, bluegill, green perch and one cute little pumpkinseed! For soft plastic, these baits really held up, too. I caught multiple fish on the same bait. They completely outfished the live minnows. I will never hit the water without these ever again!

A good friend of mine who's a big time white perch fisherman told me about the blue pearl baby shad jigs and I gave them a try last year at a pond. I instantly started catching one perch after another including my biggest one ever and it's been my go to jig since. As a comparison, my best day of perch fishing came last year when I went with 3 friends. All of them were using shiners and I was using this jig. At the end of the day we had 2 ice chests slap full of perch and I caught around 3/4 of them myself on this jig. Last weekend I went to the same spot with 5 other friends. They all used jigs of various colors and the day started slow for all of us. Even I was using a black jig at first with no luck. I switched to the trusty ol blue pearl and started catching them every cast. By the end of the day everybody was digging through my tackle box trying to find another one. I caught the vast majority of our 30 perch stringer along with several bass that were good eating size and 3 big blue gill. Time and time again the blue pearl smokes them all and I will not go perch fishing without a few packs of these.

My teenage son has become quite the avid fisherman this year. We live less than 5 minutes from a lake and he has spent all summer there. He was so excited when I got these lures for him and he was shocked at how cheap the set was! Set comes in a plastic case with 7 lures, so that is less than $2.85 a lure. He was impressed that these also came with hook bonnets (hook covers) as usually you have to buy those separately. The frogs are squishy and just the right size. These lures are large, but here is to hoping it brings luck with catching some big bass. Great set for a great price for any fisherman or fisherwoman.

We live within walking distance to a 25,000 acre lake, so needless to say, we do a lot of fishing.Fishing tackle is usually pretty expensive, that's why I was a little apprehensive we ordering this product. I have to say though, for the price, the lures are way better than I expected.The frog baits are very life like in look AND in feel. The lures have many realistic features and tiny details to them... eyes, scales, reflective coloring, etc. that add to the look and appeal and they all cone in a handy little case. You honestly can't beat this product for the price.

A nice Bass starter set. Baits are big. Some paint smudges on the eyes of one of the floating pencil--but the fish wont care.Hooks are way sharp a nice touch was they added hook covers, called hook ""bonnets"" to each hook to keep everyone safer. Typically you buy the bonnets after, it's nice they included them. They also included some extra swivels. Rattles in some of them to attract the fish.A whopper plopper alone usually costs $15 so this is a good deal on a good set since they give you two of them. They are a bit on the larger size, that just means you need to catch bigger fish.Should be able to catch Bass, Pike, no problem.This would be a great gift for a young or old fisherman to find under the Xmas tree.

This is a good selection of the popular topwater lures - whopper plopper, walk the dog, frog and poppers. All have their places in fishing and I’ll probably try them all on many occasions.Fishing has been slow this summer but I’ll definitely try these when the weather starts cooling off and the bass start fattening up for winter as well as during the spring.The paint and colors look good. They’re more on the natural side vs. over the top colors. The hooks are ok, there not Gamakatsu sharp but they’ll do. Many of the more serious fishermen replace factory hooks anyways but I typically don’t as a leisure fisherman.  The lures all come with hook protectors. It’s also nice to have a case to store and transport all the lures.There’s a lot to like in this full package.

Here’s my husband’s review:There is nothing I do not like about this lure assortment. There is nothing better than fishing top water! One of my favorite things about them is the size.

 There are a variety of top water lures of different sizes and shapes which are bound to appeal to different sizes of Bass.Should improve your success while fishing with them.The added protectors over the hooks was an unexpected plus to the kit. The size of the package would fit into most oversized fishing jacket pockets making them handy while you're fishing.Some of the lures rattle so that adds an attraction to the fish.

Most realistic craw on the market!

These are the most realistic craws you can find. I actually have caught 4, 5-7 pound channel cats on these craws while fishing for smallys. I also hooked the largest Smallmouth Ive ever hooked. Unfortunately my hook came out, to no fault of the YUM. I actually use a swimbait weighted style hook. Not a jig head but the ones with the weight on the shank of the hook. The craw stays upright and doesnt roll over.

I throw this with a parasite weight attached and 30-40% of the time it gets hit within 1 second of landing on the water surface, 40% on the way down through the water column(lite twitching on the sink) and 10% or so on the bottom light twitching it 1-2"" on the bottom. Have had more than a few bass chase it and hit it on the reel in at or near the surface fishing it from the bank or boat. I don't use any scent on it.

Man , they look exactly like a yummy crawdad. I bet they'd even fool a fish ! But , no matter how long I boiled it , even with hot hot boiled water , it just never got red or seemed to get cooked. After 2 hours , I figured it had to be done _ maybe these were some Northern type crawdad that didn't change color so I butter dunked it & started with the head ( my fav) . It was the worst, chewiest , nasty ,unfresh , bland tastin crawdad I ever tried to eat. Even w more spice n more butter , it just tasted like a tar offa the truck. I don't recommend dining on these. I threw it in the river & I saw 4 catfish fighting over the nasty tastin thing as it sunk to bottom. Let 'em have the things ....

Best crawfish plastic on the market! Rigged them many different ways but I like Texas rigged with a 3/0 low profile worm hook I’ll add a pic of what they look like rigged weedless.

Great Bait, Not Super Durable
","
These baits come in two sizes. This is the smaller one--I catch some nice sized bluegill in addition to largemouth bass with this size. I prefer the larger one, but these still work great. Because these are smaller and lighter, I have to use a little weight to cast them, whereas the larger size doesn't require that.I was blown away with their performance, but they do tend to get torn up after a few fish. Even so, what more could you expect from a plastic bait?

When the Bite Gets Slow... THESE GET BITES!
","
The Largemouth & Smallmouth bite has slowed down to almost nothing over the last couple weeks so decided to try something new. Started throwing the 2.5"" YUM Crawbug in the Crawdad color on painted 1/8 oz ball-shaped jig heads and started getting bites almost immediately. The tail-end of this soft-plastic mold is solid, so it stays put at the top of your hook - while the the body of the crawfish is hollow--this allows that half of the bait to ride higher than the weighted end as you twitch and the lure across the bottom, or through the water - - - essentially it's a nice life-like action that allows the pinchers to stay upward typically - - - the action is very, very subtle, but seems to work well. all of my bites have come close to the shoreline, a foot or two off the bank. Will likely explore the other colors as well. Definitely recommend for anyone in the market for a soft-plastic craw!

I saw this on Amazon and was willing to try it. With an impulse, I bought this. It arrived within a short period of time, unlike some products that can take forever to get here. After getting the box, I was little surprised that the plastic lures were made in decent quality. Not only are the little pieces look great, but also there is no plastic smell like some of the similar products I bought else where. I am going to use this to fish for crappie and bass. Hope spring comes soon.

The product is delivered very fast. Two days after I placed the order, I got it. Today I tried the curl tail lures out, the target fish is white bass. The lures are efficient. I got a lot of white bass. The best one for me is the dark color with shinning spots. It just worked great.The box is very nice. It is a big box with enough small cells.  I took out a couple of types of lures and put in some my commonly used ones and it becomes my lure organizer! Great product, highly recommended.

These move great through the water and there was a lot of interest from the bass and blue gill. If they were made better I would have given 5 stars but they aren’t made well and don’t last long, as I only got 4 casts out of one of them. The foil in the middle of the lures comes out way too easy! I haven’t used the middle lure in the picture, it came like that and that says a lot.

Works in salt water
","
I fish in fresh and salt water. I go fishing a LOT too. I've found that while these are listed as freshwater shads for bass, they don't really seem to catch many bass, at least not the Large Mouth Bass here in central Florida, especially when compared to a Zoom worm. So I decided to give them a go in Salt Water. Boy was I surprised! I put on a top-water for the 1st hour after the sun starts coming up and had no luck, then I changed to these with a weighted hook. Mind you, these are pretty small, so I had to use a small hook and lighter weight than with my normal DOA lures, but on my 2nd cast I got hammered by a Jack Crevalle. Next cast a Speckled Trout, then another, then another, then a Lady Fish, then another Trout, Puffer, Trout, Trout, Trout, Hard Head Cat, Trout, Jack, etc, and it stayed like this for hours. I was worn out by noon and not a single one was a keeper size. All small. So if you're just out to fish and have a good time, give these a go, but if you're looking for some Fish Tacos then you might want to have something a little bigger. But no doubt, these attract a lot of fish. Not sure why the label on these call it a ""kit"" as that usually denotes they come with hooks and other stuff, so they should label it as a ""pack"" instead.

Looks great, but overpriced
","
In the package and even once removed these look amazing! The color is really nice, the body looks quality, and the material feels nice.Where it lost me was that the silver is from foil that they insert through a hole on the underside and that made me like they were cheeping for charging a dollar each. I also wonder how it will affect it's movement in the water and if the sound of the foil clicking will cause potential fish to head the other way.There are other options that give you more bang for your buck than these that look just as good. I feel like if they gave you 10 of them it would be more reasonable. They should also lose the foil and find a way to do the silver like they did the blue so there is no longer a clicking noise.Currently I wouldn't recommend them and would say to look for better options, but if they work as nice as they look I'll have to update my review.

On the Fence
","
I received my Dr. Loft soft shad baits today.  The package acts as a nice storage container, keeping the soft bodies of the shad apart so they don't ""melt"" together.  They are very lifelike and I am anxious to see how they perform in the water.  There are supposedly some precut slots for the hook to go through, although they are not easily visible to the naked eye.  The tail is fluked and should look quite lifelike in the water.  They aren't large, just 3 inches long, but hopefully the bass will be attracted to the softness and movement and attack!!  I do recommend these soft shad baits with just a hint of reservation.

The lure looks great and the foil inside the body gives off awesome flash in the water. Caught me everything from Bluegills up to a large mouth. Only thing from giving it 5 stars is you only get 6 of them for the same price you can get 20 in a Zoom Fluke pack.

 These are probably too small for bass - I think they are going to be perfect for tossing into a mountain lake for rainbow or brown trout (I will find out in a couple of weeks and update my review).  As you can see from my video, they are very realistic and look soft and flexible enough to just twitch through the water column to entice a bite when the fish are a bit to shy or finicky to hit a noisy crank bait or paddle tail.  I'll probably rig with a small bullet weight Texas style if there is a weedy bottom, or wacky rig them if in clear water with a stony bottom.

","
I picked the pumpkin seed color, so these lifelike soft plastic lures look like tiny yellow perch, the favorite snack of a big bass. Rigging is simple, and with the smooth design they don't snag as much on weedy areas even with the hook. You can also rig them using a treble hook. I have not caught anything on them yet since I've only fished them a couple times, but they are definitely very realistic and I trust that I will catch a bass or another predatory fish on them soon. I believe they are best fished in clear water. They are flexible, with a wiggly forked tail and a piece of shiny foil on the inside, to make them more visible and reflective. If I were a predatory fish, I would be all over them. Another great tool to add to my tackle.

I was really hopeful as they look so realistic.  We tried them out in our local coastal waters and were hoping to land a blue fish or a speckled trout but couldn’t get anything to take the bait.

I took these 1.6"" grubs out today with 1/32 jig heads and was slamming crappie, bluegill, and some small bass on 2 pound test in the middle of the Texas heat. The action was what I would expect from more expensive brands. I only had 1 rip appart but it had already caught a bluegill, 2 7+""bass, some weeds, and a couple trees. I'll definitely order these again.

Product says the grubs come in10 colors, however, the package I received did not have all of the colors pictured. There are absolutely no white ones and most are translucent clear ones. The 2.8inch size is smaller than the one pictured even though my hands are small. Last, these have a very oily feel that makes your hands slimy.

Live Look and Feel
","
These lures have the look and feel of  a live bait fish. The jig is embedded in each lure making it easy to cast short and long distances. When the lure hits the water it dives down like a live bait fish searching for food. On retrieval its body and tail mimic a live fish swimming through the water.The kit comes with multiple colored fish in a compartmentalized case which is great for easy storage and lure retrieval.Each hook has a plastic insulation cover to keep you from getting jabbed. Resist the temptation to force it all the way onto the hook while in storage as this makes it very difficult to remove when you're ready to start fishing.Overall I found these lures very well built, easy and fun to use, with nothing to complain about.

After purchasing this product I was surprised. The swimmers are durable and resilient to the bites of fish with teeth. I put them to the test and caught a nice bass. The smaller profile swimmers I caught a nice Calico Bass (Black Crappie). I had a great amount of luck, and even a chain pickerel. I am going to be using some of the paddle tale swim baits for saltwater fishing, since they are very sturdy. Overall, it's a nice variety of plastic baits for mutli-species fishing.

These work great they have Excellent swimming action, much better than the Berkley version, I initial bought the Berkley ones but after only 2/3 uses the “HD” bluegill image immediately began to peel off like a temporary tattoo on top of that the plastic around the nose/mouth just started ripping apart which is weird since Berkley is a big company and they’re much more expensive. Then I found these Dovesun ones and they work great, same realistic swimming action as the Berkley ones but these actually last. On top of that the fact that they’re cheaper yet includes both the styrofoam and screw weights needed to properly set this up makes these Dovetail baits far superior. The only downside is that they are kind of cumbersome to rig properly, not a deal breaker at all just unfortunate. All and all though these are a fantastic swimbait that look incredibly realistic once they are swimming, they’re instantly a staple in my box now

I test all these baits in my pool. The Bobby Garland Baby Shad is a fantastic jig bait for crappie, but I have to admit I was not that impressed with this bait. I guess I expected a little more swimming action, in my opinion the tail paddle could have been a little larger, its still a great jig bait to use. Also the color ""Ice Out"" does not fit the picture, the top half portion of the bait that looks like a brilliant chartreuse in the photo is really a clear with a slight tint of chartreuse. In my opinion almost the oposite or reversed compared to the photo.

 Was super excited to try these worms! They did not disappoint! I bought the 5” in the more natural colors (green pumpkin , June bug etc).  I rigged them wacky style- I used a small jig head and weightless with just a hook. The worms were very durable, holding up to several fish catches. Even when they became damaged you can cut them down and rig them as a Ned style bait. I caught largemouth bass, bluegill and crappie using these. They held up great and more importantly they. flat out caught fish!

These baits are sturdy and have great action underwater. The colors they come in are on the darker/natural side, and I wish there was a little more variety, but they are good for some conditions. You get enough of these that you can experiment. They are easy to rig up a variety of ways, both weedless and with jig heads and have nice action no matter how they are rigged. Come in a nice box too.

I like to run senkos on a whacky rig, the bass around here love them.  5"" senkos are a little better for that rig because the sides flutter on the drop a little more.  Not sure why the title says 4"" 5""....these are definitely 4"".  The colors are great though and very similar to name brand lures.  They're also soft and flexible and have good action for their size.  Good value as well.

I am not sure exactly what ""Salt Impregnation"" is exactly but they claim it helps the gear sink faster in the water. I honestly couldn't really tell the difference.What I can say is that this is a good collection of $"" and 5"" worms. They have a bit of a sparkle to them which could help with fish attraction. When placing them on the hook I got the same type of resistance with more expensive worms I have bought in the past.In the end I am quite happy with this collection and I feel you are getting a good value for your money.

For an excellent addition to my tackle, I ordered the Mgotu 4"" Senko Soft Plastic Worms. I like the large quantity of soft plastic worms that come separated by color in the little box. The length is large enough to catch big bass while not being overly intimidating. The colors are mainly darker colors with shiny glitter speckles inside of each worm, which really make a difference underwater when it comes to capturing the attention of the fish. Each unit is hefty, flexible, and can be reused several times. I will be using a wacky rig most of the time when fishing these worms, in hopes of getting more movement from the ends of the worms. I will also vary the color of the worm being used depending how clear or stained the water is. I know the bass out there are actively looking for meaty worms like these, FISH ON!

I use these worms on a drop shot with a texas rig, and they work great for lake and pond fishing, The colors match any hue, and although they are mostly dark and I would have liked some brighter colored lures, they still work incredibly well and are perfect for my use. They don't rip at all and are easy to reuse, unlike, some that sort of begins to break apart after a single-use. The box is nice and I will definitely be using this on future fishing trips! Don't hesitate to buy this!

Bass (largemouth or smallmouth) love plastic worms. This style of worm catches a lot of fish and they are quite flexible in how they can be used. While most folks very successfully use weights and keep them deep, I prefer to fish them with an ultralight rod and no weights, concentrating on fishing near the surface or in shallow water. These lures are nicely made and pretty durable. the price is reasonable. I like the colors of these worms, too - quite natural looking in the water.

I was pretty pleased with this kit, and I would have given it five stars if I had actually caught something with it. But the quality of the worm plastic is nice and I could see fish biting this in the right conditions. The hooks were a bit small though. I wouldn’t have chosen this kind of hook for lure fishing because it seems like it could easily get snagged on weeds.All in all, this is a decent little kit to test your luck at freshwater lure fishing. I would recommend this to casual freshwater fishermen that don’t want to get a lot of tackle specially for freshwater. It’s convenient and it could be effective in the right hands.

Nice pack of drop shot rigs. The plastics feel like all the others, the weights seem sturdy, and I can't wait for the ice to thaw and give these a shot on the shallow river I frequent. I've bought a couple pieces to make these in the past but always lose them, so it's nice to finally have a dedicated pack. I'm finding it better to have just a couple rigs separated in my tackle bag for the task at hand, and these will add to the collection perfectly.

These rubber worms are bass candy.  I even caught crappie and bluegills on this product.  There is salt and scent on these worms which attracts fish like crazy.  I love the color combination also.

I like the baits and weights, but the hooks are terrible. The baits look good in the water, they float just enough that a little wind on the water makes them wiggle. The weights come through grass and structure pretty well. I caught a small bass on the rig though, and my hook was bent out a bit. Anything substantial and I would have lost lost the fish. The hooks are just too thin a wire. That's why I gave it 3 stars

I had a chance to do some shore fishing for bass in Alabama, and decided to try these rubber worms. While construction, length and width were all fine, there was poor color and glitter consistency within them. A few had light, almost white bellies and others had medium to dark ones.  Some worms had light sparkle flakes, two had a mix of light and blue, and one had hardly any glitter flakes at all.  Overall, the worms had great action. The included hooks and weights were also adequate

Different Action Weightless Than Most Finesse Worms
","
I always use Zoom finesse worms, but I found some of these on sale and decided to give them a try.  They're fairly similar to most other straight finesse worms, but they're slightly on the greasy/oily side of most soft plastics.  I caught a few fish using it as a drop shot bait, and then I went sight fishing with one weightless on a #1 Owner Covershot.Weightless ,instead of a 'flat' type of motion (i.e., the way a senko falls) the worm sinks nose down.  It has a moderate to fast fall rate, and the tail generally stands up on the bottom for 10-20 seconds before falling over.  I caught a few decent ones using it weightless, although I think the nose-forwards fall is a specific type of presentation, and the more regular type is probably suited for most general situations.

Swim baits are my number one go to, so I decided to try these, since they had a variety of colors.Overall I'm satisfied with the choice of colors, but they were so overpacked into a small container that some of the tails were deformed which makes them almost useless.It would have been much better if the box had been deeper or even double sided, and being a bit wider would have prevented the tails from getting scrunched.

Good quality lures. I have them in several colours and on a number of occasions they have worked for me when nothing else does. My local canal has been really hard recently, especially with the weather all over the place, but when I switch to one of these I always seem to manage to save the blank. I think they offer something different to the lures that the fish are used to seeing. Work great on the drop shot or standard jig head but my preferred way to fish them are on a cheb rig.

I have been fishing with these for 2 full weeks, they are no good. I have for the last 5 days switched to another brand of the exact same color (Literally removed the worm and rehooked a different brand) I get hits on the other brand without changing a thing.  Based on the Amazon reviews I tried this brand, but they have been really disappointing. They have an odd smell as well. A little bit like spoiled milk. Maybe I got unlucky with a bad bag. If this isn’t your brand, I would stick to what you know. Back to Gary for me.

These are WAY too stiff and have zero action.A good wacky worm wiggles as it slowly sinks. These worms are like a pencil. No action at all. That is what makes a wacky worm successful. These will work as an impulse bite only if you drop it on their head! They are also way too buoyant. They barely sink at all. Great price but a poor product. Yamamoto senkos are more expensive than these knockoffs but  Yamamoto senkos lure fish into striking.Been fishing wacky worms for years and tried them all hoping these were cheap replacements. They are cheap... but not a replacement for proven wacky worms.

This isn’t the intended purpose, but I use these for keeping spinner baits centered on the string. I put this on the bent metal bit where you tie on and it keeps the string/barrel swivel from sliding up and down the metal and tangling. Very helpful!

I purchased these after my state sent a concerning email about the amount of soft baits being seen in waterways. I'm hopeful that others will  use them as well to mitigate losing soft plastic lures and to extend the life of your supplies. Couldn't be happier with Harmony Fishing products, top notch.

Must Have for Soft Plastics
","
As others have stated, you need to buy the correct size for the hooks that you plan to use. I am a saltwater fisherman and I often need to make long casts. Soft plastics are tough to fish properly with powerful casts as they tend to slide around on the hook. These bait pegs solve this problem and are staying in place even when I use heavy surf rods to make very long casts with lures like Slug-Gos. I highly recommend these to anyone using soft plastic lures.

I like fishing plastic jigs because of the convenience of easily changing colors without having to re-tie, that being said the durability of some plastics becomes a issue when you get on a big school of slabs.

I picked this Johncoo bait shad imitators #F color which is orange on top and light green / yellow on the bottom. They contain reflective glitter pieces inside of the lure body, which in my opinion, would make the presentation more attractive and realistic to any predatory fish. The bag brings a large quantity for the price, and these can be used many times without falling apart. In my experience, the freshwater fish I go after have always seemed to prefer brighter colors, which is why I went with that #F. These soft bait lures are easily rigged up on a jig head hook and are easy to fish. They look realistic underwater and have plenty of tail movement. I have fished them a couple of times but have not caught anything on them yet. I am confident that these will turn out useful on future fishing trips. However, don't expect these to last forever if you fish heavy cover or sharp rocky beds. For their price and utility, I recommend them as a great addition to your tackle box.

Not bad at all but, Aluminum molds are still far superior.
","
B+ The baits come out well, however they are a bit dull due to having to use oil to lube the mold with. So if you care about the bait being shiny then this isn't for you. I don't mind this as much in a craw or creature bait. Aluminum is still the way to go if you want perfect baits as you don't have to use oil to lube aluminum and they come out shiny and without sticking as these stone molds can do if not enough oil is used. I would still recommend these if you are a beginner to see if you like the hobby. I would also suggest getting a mold that has more than 1 cavity like this one as the single cavity ones are similarly priced and, if you do the math, to make as many in one shoot it would cost you as much as just buying a multi-cavity aluminum mold. So up to you.Catching them on sale would be the way to go.

I haven't used these yet, but had similar products that had less detail and worked really great if you ""know"" how to present them. I no longer use live baits and hadn't for over a decade and caught 2lb sunfish in MN with these types of soft bait lures. they look like real ""shiners"" we call them in MN and you really can't get better than that. Because, if they're not really biting then there is no lost in real live bait. But, like any professional fisherman will tell you, use what's closest to what is in the lake that they mostly feed on and you'll be more successful, because it's not the lure that really makes you successful in fishing, it's the knowledge.

To be honest, I'm more of a trout fisherman, so I have little experience with catching bass. My first impression of these lures is that they look legit.

nice lures

these lures are pretty good. they do come with a fairly strong licorice scent and are a bit slippery to try to get on the hooks. They are very stretchy and durable and seem to entice the fish into biting them. They come with two different sizes of hooks and when they're in the water the lures tails float straight up. I haven't managed to catch anything on them, but that is most likely due to me being a new to fishing, then the fault of the lures.

I went out walking up Darby Creek outside of Columbus, Ohio. It has a reputation for good smallmouth fishing and I can attest to that, but the water was low.Never less, I took these baits and hit the water. I threw the one pictured with a couple bumps, but  the smallmouth I caught came on green pumpkin. A 15” fish!They’re so tantalizing..! They stand up like elaztech and are pretty durable too.I can’t wait to take out in my boat. I have a feeling they’ll shine.

Received this package today and went out after work to try it out.The lures smell good. They smell like a coffee or some other scent similar to lures I’ve used in the past. Not sure what another reviewer was complaining about.The lures  have descent action. They can be worked easily.I typically only use the X-man Ned pro mushroom hooks which never disappoint me so using this hook is definitely different and I had concern of losing fish on a hookset because the gap of the hook. Well after catching a couple fish those concerns were gone. Also the hook proved to be sharp enough. The hooks also grip well. The fish weren’t going to come off easily.The proof is in the catch I suppose. Fish on!

Nice variety, great value

This is a nice package deal with 10 Ned jig heads in 2 sizes, and 25 worm bodies in 5 colors. This is a great value for what you receive.I really like the flat nose on the jig heads - it gives a great vertical presentation to the plastics.On my first cast with the red/Hot Craw color combo on 8 lb. fluoro line, hooked a 3 lb largemouth.I don't usually like offset hooks, but these are laser sharp, and have performed great so far - no missed strikes, and they allow a weedless rig that worked well for me in sparse coontail and cabbage weeds.The plastics have a good infused scent and are very flexible  - but not so soft that they tear apart easily. I caught 5 bass with one ribbed worm and it's still holding together.The kit is packaged in a 7""x7"" clear plastic divided tray and covered in a zip lock bag that keeps everything organized nicely!Others mentioned the worms ""melt""... I haven't noticed that yet, but as a precaution I'll keep them in the original tray and bag to prevent them from sticking to other plastics.This kit has enough color variety that it would make a perfect gift for any bass angler.Overall, I'm very happy with this kit and look forward to catching more fish with these components.

The hooks are sharp and the weight seems about right. I don't think they're too heavy for fishing off a boat or dock on deeper water.

I finally had the opportunity to try these lures in salt water on Pacific mackerel; I scored action whenever I was able to locate the schools.  These lures remind me of the old 1950's LS Mirro-lures, which were deadly on crappies. I have no doubts they will be killers in fresh water, I will update this review in a month or two.

Far Casting Brick
","
The overall construction of this lure is solid as a rock.  The paint is generic and chipped at the eyelet.  It casts far along the beach, but as it's almost an ounce, this needs a retrieval rate faster than usual.  Due to its weight, it feels like it sinks down to the bottom as I can feel it which ends up reeling in seaweed instead of fish.  Best bet, cast this far and retrieve quick along the ocean shore.

The soft plastic material is pretty durable and don’t rip too easily. I would of given 5 stars had it not been for the shotty case these came in. Wish they were in a plastic baggy like all other soft plastics come in so they don’t dry out. The case don’t even line up correctly to close so their is huge gaps on the sides of it which is annoying since now I have to find something else to put these in. The case came wrapped in plastic and when I took the plastic off the whole case was covered in a oily like substance which I’m guessing is the fish attractant that’s applied to most soft plastic baits but since the case is so shotty it didn’t conceal the oil and it leaked out everywhere which I wouldn’t want happening in my expensive tackle bag.

I do not think the lure will affect the hookup ratio in any negative way. They are also scented. It's not overly strongg, but you know it's there.The action is also great. While bouncing it along the bottom it hopped quickly but stood up on bottom when paused. You can also swim it through the water. I was able to create a wave just below the surface and also cause disturbance like a top water lure.The bad....I'll start with the scent. Whatever is used was all over the packaging and case. Luckily I put it down on a hard surface because it left a big grease mark. I think it would have stained fabric. Being they are so soft, they will not stay up on a Texas rig with an offset hook. I had to pull it back up the hook every other cast. I just know not to fish it with a Texas rig. I will try a jig head or hook with bait holders. I will also try the swivel trick with the T Rig because these seem great.I am excited to keep trying these.

Very Well Made

I normally mold my own soft baits. However, I saw these and decided to get them. I had never seen the shape before.With this many folds/corners/fills/etc. I was skeptical if they would be complete. To my surprise, they were. That says a lot. I did not see any gaps or misfills. Very well done. Plus they come in a good color selection for whatever you may need.Will they catch fish? That depends on you. Use the right bait, the right way, at the right time and you stand a good chance.

These have decent action and will hold stink bait
","
Careful, the lubricant on these is excessive--covering inside and outside of the cellophane covering the box these lures come in.  Of course, saying that, it should be understood the box is greasy inside and out.  I need to store the box in a ziplock bag.The lures work fine.  I'm always on the lookout for lures with deep ridges and its that can hold some stink bait for more than a few minutes.Be aware that these lures are not as wide as they look in the pictures.  They are actually about double the diameter of a worm.  So, they are worm-like with tapered ridges.

So I wasn't sure... I didn't know what to expect. Then I found out that bass like these both drop shotted and Carolina rigged and slow fished.Most of the bite indicated the bass tried to swallow as they we hooked way back when Carolina rigged.I would say try em you will likely enjoy using them and add more fish to your day.

Good chatterbait trailer
","
As the title says it’s a good chatterbait trailer. First off this plastic is an elastomer type plastic. With that said it’s very stretchy and durable. It’s similar to Nikko or Z-Man type plastics. The ridges are deep with slots in the plastic for different rigging methods. The plastic is similar in features to a yotoworm. It has an erratic action that complements any bladed jig. The size is perfect for trailer use. It comes as a package of 5 different colors to match your different colored jigs. This is a great kit overall. Only negatives I see are they are super lubricated, and I don’t know if this elastomer type plastic will play well with other plastics in my box because this type tends to melt non elastomer plastics. I will update if there are such issues.

Great frogs, easy to transport case, variation in design
","
These frogs have a 4 varied designs that allow for some experimentation in the water. Only reason for the 4/5 rating is i would have preferred some longer tails to allow me to trim them but they work just fine as is. The case is also great to keep them isolated and avoid getting tangled up.

Inconsistent Quality
","
Not all of the frogs have the realistic looking eyes, some are just painted on. One of the frogs came with a messed up foot and leg. Which I thought maybe the fish would go for because it looks injured…but no fish were caught with it. The silicone is very squishy and the hooks are sharp. They are truly weedless, I was ripping them across lily pads without catching on anything. Use strong braid with them. This set isn’t terrible, I just wish the quality and craftsmanship were more consistent across the frogs.

Bass jump on these like candy.  I have many favorite lures over the years but nothing beats a frog.  Especially for Large Mouth that I am after.  These lures are well made and durable.  The hooks are very sharp and strong.  These move great in the water and I have no issues catching big fish.

GREAT CHOICES OF COLORS
","
These frogs have all the right colors, for every clarity of water. They have great top water action, they can be fished on top of the water by reeling pretty fast to start, that way they stay on top of the water, if you cast and let it sit it sinks and will run below the surface. The feet on the frogs turn and churn the water when on top of the water, this creates noises and arouses the fish. Great bait worth the cost!

No complaints on these. They look great and seem to work well. The action is pretty good, though I wonder how long the feet will continue to move. But they do good popping across the top of the water if you work them right. I didn't get any bites with them yet, but sometimes frog lures just don't get any strikes for me. But these are good quality, work well, and at $12 for 5 lures, it's a great deal.

 My husband and I are moderate fishers and are really hoping these catch us some Bass or any other predatory fish in our lake.These frogs are a good size, are very realistic looking, have hidden hooks in the body, and also have included moderate weight lead sinkers.I like the variety of colors.  Depending on time of day and water color, you have several different choices for a better score.I like that these are similar to whopper poppers that we are all familiar with.  These also pop across the water with the rotating feet making the noise and attracting fish.The double barbed hooks and line rings seem to be solid and well made.As soon as we get out on the lake, I'll do an edit of this post and share results.Until then, I'm very pleased with what I received.

Well what can I say, they look nice but they don’t perform at all. They get water in super fast, if they float, they float on their backs. One positive, hooks are sharp. Cheap 1$ frogs from big retail store work much better. I had high hopes but nope, they will not do.

I fish in all sorts of ponds and lakes, and these are great for ponds you can't get all the way on the bank (because of weeds and brush) and also the type that have a lot of algae and big piles of swampy lake material by the bank. You can hop this thing up on there and scoot it along to really get some big fish biting.  Plus you can cast this a looong way because it has a little weight too it. This 5 pack should last me a long time unless I get them stuck in a tree. With the right amount of action these look very real.

",5.0
B09NDWJZ8N,R3M1XSQ1TQJFRM,"

A few things to be mindful of with this injector:  CONS1.there is no locking pin to hold the cap in place so at times the cap will fall off during injection.2. There is an excessive amount of resistance when trying to fill & empty the injector. Often requires lubricant to ease this process.3. The injector looks much bigger in advertisement photos- be mindful of this!4. The internal seal on the plunger will often unscrew from the rod causing you to have to fix this repeatedly.PROS:  if you don’t mind all of above inconveniences slowing you down, then it’s a decent product.  There are better injectors out there- but they will cost more.  It’s just a matter of whether you want to save a few dollars and deal with the issues.

It's January and -8 tonight, so it will be months before I get to fish these worms.  That said, they don't seem to have a lot of salt, and so should sink on the slower side which I prefer.  They have a generous amount of embedded sparkle, so even the darker color should have some extra eye appeal.  The colors are almost exactly as shown and there isn't any surprises here.  I know from past experience that the bright red worm will be fine (my first bass over 5lbs was caught on a red worm with white spots) and I am not worried about the others.  I've not ran a hook into them, but they seem tough enough to dangle from an O-ring.  The plastic box that they come in seems perfectly fine and I anticipate using it long after I'm out of these worms.  Overall this was a good value.

Great lures but poor hooks and swivels
","
I immediately switched out the hooks for treble hooks and the split rings. The split rings may work fine, but I fish a lot for trout and they tend to twist and spin a lot while landing and the split rings on these are very thin, so to be safe I felt a need to replace. Didn't want to risk losing that big fish and the lure.

Smallmouth slayer
","
This swim baits swims better than any other paddle tails I've used and slays the smallmouth in my area. It ""tracks"" good in the water, the tail moves like it should while the body of the bait stays in line. I throw it weightless on a 2/0 or 3/0 hook. Would be good for trailers as well. After a big fish or 2 smaller fish it gets pretty tore up but no doubt it catches fish. I ordered one pack to try out after hearing kickintheirbasstv talk about 6th Sense and wanted to try em out, I've since ordered 9 more packs. And will be back for more.

Like others, getting this lure early, before the season really opens up, is torture. I really want to try these lures out for Striped Bass at the mouth of the Connecticut River, but that will take a few more weeks.The colors look so realistic and the body is translucent enough to really look like a real squid. Just a word of caution. (but NOT a complaint), these lures are advertised as 5.9"" but that includes the tail. The body is only 2.5"".

These are great size squid lure with a perfect 2.12oz weight to it that gives a pretty long distant toss on braided lines.Got these specifically for catching California halibut but have not had any luck during the month of may trolling on my kayak or off the pier. Maybe better luck in March.The 2.12oz sink pretty nicely down to the bottom. The two hook did get me snag few times around some structure. Luckily my 50 pound braided line was strong enough to get it unsnag. So stick to Sandy bottom or troll without hitting the bottom.

It’s good. Squid looks very realistic, and I actually got few Rockfish. However, I don’t know the reason why, but while I was sending it down to the bottom, sometimes one of the hook get caught at the top of Squid’s head.(see pic) Maybe I was just using wrong size’s sinker.

Flexible fishing lure set that works in both saltwater and freshwater
","
I do a lot of camping and paddlesports, and have been looking to get into some fishing while on trips. I just recently did a 7 day camping trip along the coast of South Carolina and was able to use this fishing lure set on 3 days of fishing.I'm a beginner with fishing so that's the standpoint of this review. The lures seem to work for a variety of fish in different conditions. I was fishing mostly a saltwater lagoon, and was able to catch 2 speckled sea trout with these lures so that was pretty amazing.I have not tried these yet in freshwater so I cannot speak to that.From a beginner standpoint it was a little confusing on how the lures go onto the jig set so some diagrams or text for that would be a nice addition.

A great kit to start jigging plastic baits.
","
There is a quite an assortment of standard plastic baits and jig heads to help you get started fishing with plastic jigs. The kit comes with several types of plastic baits, all designed to be used with lead jig heads, of which the kit contains several types. It also comes with a set of swivels, but I recommend typing the lure directly to the line. You can also use unweighted hooks and fish on or near the surface. This kit represents a pretty good value for a starter kit.

Responsive, very slow sinking

I would not recommend using these without a weight, at the minimum I would encourage a few split shots or even a texas rig. These weights are very light, and I will only use the paddle tails since the mouse tails don't seem to get results. Luckily, they come with plenty, and I think this will be a great option when going out to the lake. This comes with everything you need, and the colors are all usable, unlike some other sets that give you such absurd colors you just end up throwing them in the trash. In short, this is a great kit, but I wish that some of them had come preweighted at the nose, given the price.

EDITED TO ADD: I still love this bait. The construction and the swimming action are way better than the price suggests. What I will suggest, however, is that if you're going to buy this bait, change out the treble hooks. My front treble had one of the hook points snap off on a 4 pounder. Not a deal killer, but the hardware could be a little better.I'm a pretty big swimbait aficionado and decided to try the more budget offerings since most of everything on the market is made in WeiHai, China, which is where Johncoo is based.Overall I'm very pleased with this bait. The construction quality is good, the hooks are sturdy and sharp and the bait's action in the water is surprisingly good. Would buy more, for sure.

Only complaint is the hole the line goes through needs a little smoothing. Did it with a drill bit by hand. Great value though.

Has a great action when twitched, casts decent, nice sub surface walk the dog action, just wish it had a little wider lazy swim on a straight retrieve and this lure would be absolutely perfect. A great and much cheaper priced version of the Megabass I-slide135 b. Literally less than 25% the price with 95% of the action. I think that's a good deal

I love these little guys! I've caught everything from bass, catfish, crappie and sunfish. Got my money's worth. Sometimes it's been a big swing and a miss trying new baits. Not with these guys. I've tried all the colors except the amber and I've caught on all of them. I'll get about 15 sunfish on one before it starts tearing around the hook, this seems exceptable. Will definitely be reordering.

Don’t spend money on this junk

Don’t buy this junk. Eyes are not glued on the jig heads. If they hadn’t already fallen off in the package, as soon as you touch them they come off. Cheap hooks that are nowhere big enough for crappie. The soft plastic minnows tear really easy, and are extremely small. Don’t be fooled by the pictures and reviews. I wouldn’t take another one of these kits if they were giving them away for free. Not worth one star.

Good size for catching almost any ""eating-size"" fish!
","
I fish for most species, depending on what is biting.  Quite a few will bite this lure.I got the crappie body style which is more slender and looks more like the live minnows that I'm used to using.  Of course, I think the fish here in Georgia would bite the shad body style just as well, so I don't think the body style will matter much.This way I fish this style lure is to cast it out, let is sink a couple of seconds or more depending on how deep I want the lure to run.  Then I reel it in at a steady to fast rate.  The fish think it is a minnow trying to escape and if they see it, they will usually bite!  Sometimes a faster reeling rate works best.Here's something to try.... For fun, I like to go to a local stocked catfish pond and use these to bring in my catfish!  Many people think that you have to use raw chicken livers for catfish and that you need to fish by letting the bait sit on the bottom, but that isn't always true.  Catfish will bite anything that looks like food if they are hungry enough, especially the fish in stocked catfish ponds.  They will attack this size lure as well.  In this situation, you fish them just like you would for bass or crappie.The catfish pond I go to does not allow treble hooks, so these lures are perfect.  I'll bring in a fish every two or three casts with these.  The hooks might be a little small for the big lunker bass, but I usually want to catch fish to eat, so these lures are the perfect size to bring in ""eating-sized"" fish!

These little things move in a fairly lifelike manner and I’ve gotten a good number of bites from fish while using them and I caught a pretty big saltwater cat with one. These were surprisingly fresh when I opened the pack. The colors are done well and they have lasted a lot longer than I expected. I’m planning on buying some more when I finish going through this set because I got bites in both fresh and saltwater. These are some handy things and I like them a lot.Pros:Made wellGood colorsSharp hooksGood weight distributionFish liked it in salt and fresh waterGood valueCons:None so far

Good quality set of crappie jigs with a good case
","
I got these Crappie-Baits- Plastics-Jig-Heads-Kit-Shad-Minnow-Fishing-Lures-for Crappie-Panfish-Bluegill-40-Piece Kit - 30 Bodies- 10 Crappie Jig Heads in recently and they work great very good quality.I fish for all kinds of fish but my favorite is fishing for crappie. I guess it’s because when your fishing and you come across a bed of crappie you can just seat there all night and pull in 30 or more of them. These jigs will work great for that.You get-30 rubber bodies-6 different colors and each  one has really good detail.-10 Jig heads- you get 2 different weights  5 -1/16 oz and 5 -1/32 oz each one has a  solid hook with a barb. Plus a spinner  attached to each one that’s very reflective-case- good quality case that latches shut and  has 6 different compartments for each  color jigOverall this is a great set of crappie jigs with a good solid case.I would recommend these

My wife and I are what we would consider avid fishermen. We enjoy catfishing, bass fishing and crappie fishing any chance we get. We’ve spent a ton on fine tuning our rods and enhancing our tackle selection. These would be one of our best lures for the price. The hooks are nice and the jigs themselves are of really nice quality. Soft, but at the same time incredibly durable.My first cast in nice water yielded me a 2.5 lbs largemouth. It surprised me because we bought these strictly for crappie fishing.Best bang for your Buck!
